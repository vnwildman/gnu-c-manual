The GNU C Reference Manual
==========================

(This manual is part of the GNU Project.)

This is a reference manual covering the C programming language as
implemented by the GNU C compiler.  It does not cover the C libraries.
THIS MANUAL IS STILL INCOMPLETE!  As of 4 February 2004, this is a
work-in-progress, and should not be misconstrued as a finished project.

The Texinfo source for this manual is split into several files, with
one file per chapter.  To build the manual, process the file
`gnu-c-manual.texi' using `makeinfo', `texi2dvi', or the Texinfo
formatting program of your choice.
